Nonblocking data structures
===========

This repository stores a number of C, C++, and Java nonblocking data structures developed, in whole or in part, by members of the Parallelism and Concurrency Lab at Lehigh University.

If you cannot find a data structure that you expect to be here, based on our
publications, please contact Mike Spear.  It's likely that the code is in a
private repository, but can be merged into this repository.

Note: code in support of our recent work on Transactional Acceleration of
Concurrent Data Structures can be found in the tsx_accleration/ folder
